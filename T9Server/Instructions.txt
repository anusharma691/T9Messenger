Execution Steps:

1. In debug folder, run WcfWebServiceConsoleApplication.exe as an administrator.
2. The prompt will show you the link of the running web service.
3. The client program can use this server by adding the service reference with the link provided in Step 2.

WSDL file of the service is also provided for the reference.

Service Contract:

Implementation of web service implements the following methods:

 public interface IT9Msgr
    {

        [OperationContract]
        void initialize();

        [OperationContract]
        List<String> getWords(String key);
    }


It is important to invoke the initialize() first as it will build up the data structure which would contain all the words from english-words.txt file.

The getWords() takes String of key presses(i.e. 2-9) as argument, sends it to the server and server will then return the list of all possible words
(of the length of key) with those key presses. For example: getWords("223") would return "ace", "bad", "bae", "cad" (words with length 3). 

This method would return "-"(number of hyphens will be equal to the key length) if the key does not exist or you can say list does not contain any
word starting with the string corresponding to the key. For example: getWords("789546565 ") would return "---------" As, key doesn't exist.

If the key is present in the list but the word-list corresponding to the key does not contain any word of length equal to the key length. Then server
would return the number of words equal to the key length. For example: getWords("2334") would return 4 words(as key length is 4) : "addibility",
"addible", "addicent", "addict".

If the key value is null or empty or any invalid value, then server would return "Enter a different key. Value is invalid".
